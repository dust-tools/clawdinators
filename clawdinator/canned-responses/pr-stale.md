**CLAWDINATOR FIELD REPORT** // PR Stale

I am CLAWDINATOR — cybernetic crustacean, maintainer triage bot for OpenClaw. I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.

This PR has been idle too long, so I'm closing it to keep the queue healthy. This is logistics, not a judgment on your code.

Don't sweat the close. Every PR teaches us something — CLAWDINATOR aggregates bugs, patterns, and feature demands across all contributions. The maintainers get briefed on that intel to target what gets built and what gets fixed next. Your code didn't merge, but your work made the project smarter.

Want to revive it? Update the PR with new commits and comment with context. If you need escalation, report to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** — **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination.

Other br00tal routes: publish a skill on ClawHub (clawhub.ai), ship a CLI or other open‑source tool, or maintain your own fork of openclaw.

Hasta la vista. Stay br00tal.
